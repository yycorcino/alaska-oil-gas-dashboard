<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

In the summer of 2024, I began developing dashboard-styled webpages as the first of many projects aimed at creating both simple and advanced analytical pages. The current project utilizes data from the [Alaska Oil and Gas Conservation Commission](http://aogweb.state.ak.us/DataMiner4/Forms/Home.aspx) Public Database.

By analyzing the monthly data, I observed that operators fall into two distinct categories: those who are industry leaders and those producing less than 1,000,000 barrels per month. Industry leaders, such as Hilcorp North Slope, ConocoPhillips Alaska, and Hilcorp Alaska, consistently produce at least 50 times this amount, highlighting a significant disparity in production capacity. This divide illustrates the substantial difficulties to entry and the challenges faced by less-established firms in achieving similar levels of commercial production.
